        <p>A team of 5 developers who love to cook and eat but don't always want to adhere to the guidance of another recipe.
        So our goal is to provide a platform for users to search for recipes and save them to make their own personal changes, to creating their own personal recipe book.
        We've utilized a pre-existing API search database called 'I NEED TO PLACE THAT HERE AND MAKE IT A LINK'.
        So feel free to make searches and save a selection and open in a personal dashboard 'MAKE A LINK OF DASHBOARD BUT PROVIDE PROMPT TO LOGIN OR SIGNUP' with editor to start creating your own book today.</p>
